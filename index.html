  <h1>Phishing Campaign Simulation</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p>This was a controlled phishing campaign conducted to assess organizational awareness around phishing threats using <a href="https://getgophish.com">GoPhish</a>.</p>

  <h2>Campaign Summary</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Detail</th>
      <th>Info</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Target Audience</td>
      <td>Internal staff at <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delivery Method</td>
      <td>Email (via trusted-looking IT support alias)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Landing Page</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Goal</td>
      <td>Measure click rate and login attempts</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vultr VPS running Ubuntu</li>
    <li>GoPhish server hosted behind an Nginx reverse proxy</li>
    <li>Custom domain with email aliases</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Email & Page Details</h2>
  <p>A professionally written email posed as an internal IT message. The link led to a spoofed login page that logged credentials without storing any real passwords or sensitive data.</p>

  <h2>Ethical Disclosure</h2>
  <p>All testing was fully authorized by the organization. No personal data was stored or exposed. The target organization has been redacted to maintain confidentiality.</p>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>The results are being used to improve user training and security posture. A final report has been shared with stakeholders to guide remediation and awareness efforts.</p>
