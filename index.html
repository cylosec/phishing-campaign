  <h1>Phishing Campaign Simulation</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p>This was a controlled phishing campaign conducted to assess organizational awareness around phishing threats using <a href="https://getgophish.com">GoPhish</a>.</p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Test users' ability to identify suspicious emails and determine the click/open rate of a crafted phishing link.</p>

  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vultr VPS running Ubuntu</li>
    <li>GoPhish server hosted behind an Nginx reverse proxy</li>
    <li>Custom domain with email aliases</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Email Details</h2>
  <p>A professional-looking email was crafted to resemble IT support, containing a link to a spoofed login portal.</p>

  <h2>Landing Page</h2>
  <p>The landing page mimicked a real login form and tracked user interactions. All data collected was non-sensitive and part of the simulation.</p>

  <h2>Redacted Target Info</h2>
  <p>The organization name has been redacted for confidentiality. All activities were authorized and performed ethically.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The results are being analyzed and will inform improved training and alerting procedures going forward.</p>
